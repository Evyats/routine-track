i want this to use a router so there will be an option to go back to the homepage when pressing back in the browser after getting to the example page.

"today" and "example" components should look more like the buttons in the example page (border for example is too roinded for them in our implementation).

instead of "today" - write the date in format of "THU | 13.1.2025"

icons inside the buttons - center them on both axis.

in light mode - background of the components shouldbe brighter so it has contrast from the main bg.

* please stick to exactly what i am asking for, without changing anything further than that.
