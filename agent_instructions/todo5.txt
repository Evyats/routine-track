TODO (no user-visible behavior changes)

- Split App responsibilities into smaller files without changing behavior:
  - Move routineTasks to a data module (e.g., src/data/routineTasks.ts).
  - Move useStopwatch and useCountdown to hooks (e.g., src/hooks/useStopwatch.ts, src/hooks/useCountdown.ts).
  - Move TaskCard and TimedTaskCard to components (e.g., src/components/TaskCard.tsx, src/components/TimedTaskCard.tsx).
  - Keep App.tsx focused on routing and composition only.

- Remove unsafe event casting in the stopwatch circle handler by separating:
  - A pure toggle action (start/pause) and
  - A ripple calculation function that only runs for pointer events.
  This should preserve existing keyboard and click behavior exactly.

- Deduplicate shared TaskCard layout by extracting a shared shell component or render helper,
  while preserving markup structure and CSS classes to avoid any visual changes.
