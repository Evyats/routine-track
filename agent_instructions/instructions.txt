that is a template and therefore include some "example" stuff. i like the general styling of it so i wanna build on top of it. 

i want to build a very minimal app of a daily routine tracker. every day i want to make the following 4:
Read high-quality existing GitHub code (20 min)
Use a new AI tool (30 min)
Generate 3 chatgpt programming questions
Commit changes to codebase and send to github

i want to have a checklist with these 4.
near the ones limited by time - i want a timer near them that can be activated, and control for pause or reset and that stuff, and when it ends i want a nice sound.

also - above these 4 - i want a big stopper on the screen. i activate it when i start learning and pausing it sometimes, and it is for me to see at the end of the day how much time i spent actually studying.
